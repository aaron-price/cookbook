# Cookbook

### Introduction

I learn by doing. But most of the time when I learn something, I don't immediately have a project that requires it.

This is the project where I can immediately use anything I learn, even if I'm only copying it down.

### Django
I'm learning python and django, but coming from a JS, Node, and react background. This is mainly my notes on how to do anything in django.

### Test Driven Calculus
I spontaneously bought a calculus textbook, despite being a math dropout. I'm also picking up python this weekend. Why not use one to learn the other?

I write unit tests for a calculus formula, in python, then write passing functions to express the formulae.
