Today I spontaneously went into an 'educational books surplus store', and I bought a used calculus textbook.

"Wow calculus, what school are you going to?"
"Hah nooo, I'm just a nerd"
*awkward pause* "that'll be $29.99..."

For the record, I'm a math dropout. I've been told my whole life that I'm 'gifted', yet I used to hate math as it was taught by the public education system. Nobody could give me a half decent reason to learn it, aside from raw obedience, so I refused. I even went so far as attempting to organize a high school boycott of math. Nobody joined me.

Yet, here I am. Having taught myself programming, suddenly math is relevant. Relevant and *cool*. It's the language of the universe

I also recently (as in yesterday) decided to learn python. I'm not new to programming, but I am new to python. I figure I can use both python and calculus to learn each other.
